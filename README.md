# fun-neural-style-transfer
I'm very bored! I don't know how long it would take to complete (I meant, my new model)! So, I suppose I need to have something to do! This project sounds fun and exciting ðŸ¤©, and a little bit needs some different configurations, which I'm going to show you how to do it! Stay tuned!

## How to use?
Open your terminal and follow the process step by step.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m3hrdadfi/fun-neural-style-transfer.git app
cd app

python transfer.py \
    --language pt \
    --content_image_path SPECIFY_YOUR_CONTENT_IMAGE_PATH \
    --content_type d \
    --style_image_path SPECIFY_YOUR_STYLE_IMAGE_PATH \
    --style_type e \
    --log_every_step 500 \
    --steps 4000 \
    --learning_rate 1e-3 \
    --style_weights 0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2 \
    --alpha 8.0 \
    --beta 1e4 \
    --save_dir SPECIFY_YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR
```

For more information
```bash
python transfer.py --h
```

Output
```bash
usage: transfer.py [-h] --content_image_path CONTENT_IMAGE_PATH
                   [--content_type CONTENT_TYPE] --style_image_path
                   STYLE_IMAGE_PATH [--style_type STYLE_TYPE] --language
                   LANGUAGE [--style_weights STYLE_WEIGHTS] [--alpha ALPHA]
                   [--beta BETA] [--steps STEPS]
                   [--log_every_step LOG_EVERY_STEP]
                   [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE] [--save_dir SAVE_DIR]

## Final Result
Neural Style Transfer (NST) depends on two entities, a content and a style. It accepts one pair of images, one as content and the other as a styler. Then, it produces a new target that preserves the content and tries to shift the style of primary into the styler. In summary:

- Content image used as a basis that provides objects and arrangements for the target.
- Style image used as a painter (styler) to transfer its style, colors, and textures to the target image.
