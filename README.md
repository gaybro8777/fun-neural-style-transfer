# fun-neural-style-transfer
I'm very bored! I don't know how long it would take to complete (I meant, my new model)! So, I suppose I need to have something to do! This project sounds fun and exciting ðŸ¤©, and a little bit needs some different configurations, which I'm going to show you how to do it! Stay tuned!

## Final Result
Neural Style Transfer (NST) depends on two entities, a content and a style. It accepts one pair of images, one as content and the other as a styler. Then, it produces a new target that preserves the content and tries to shift the style of primary into the styler. In summary:

- Content image used as a basis that provides objects and arrangements for the target.
- Style image used as a painter (styler) to transfer its style, colors, and textures to the target image.
